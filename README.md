# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

## To run Elixir solutions (.exs files)
1. Make sure [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) is installed
2. Navigate to directory of day and run <code>elixir day*X*.exs</code> or <code>elixir day*X*part2.exs</code>
> Note: The script handles loading the input from the included text file. To change the input, simply change the values in the text file. 

When starting on part 2 of a puzzle, I normally copy over my solution from part 1 into another file. This is to show if there was any significant change to my code or thinking for part 2 since I normally don't go back and edit part 1 if I find a better solution while working on part 2.
